# Synergy - Unity App
A hackathon project that visualises sensor data from a building with an app made in Unity.

This part of the project is the Unity project which can be built for IOS and Android. It gets sensor data by querying an endpoint provided by [the simulator repo](https://github.com/HudsonFinn/synergy-hackzurich). Which provides time accelerated data as if it was coming from a real building.

### Setup
Start by cloning this repo to your local environment and open it in Unity 2021.3.9f1, now follow either:
- [This tutorial](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/android-BuildProcess.html) which shows how to deploy the app to an android phone.
- [This tutorial](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/BuildSettingsiOS.html) which shows how to deploy the app to an IPhone.
